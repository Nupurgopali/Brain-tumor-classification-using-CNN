# Brain-tumor-classification-using-CNN
I have made a CNN model to classify whether the MRI brain scan has tumor or not.
<h1>AIM</h1>
<p>The main aim of this project is to use the CNN model and then classify whether a particular MRI scan has a tumor or not.</p>
<p>Since the tumor is very difficult to be seen via naked eyes. I thought building and training a CNN model would be an easy solution to identify if the patient suffers from a brain tumor or not.</p>
<h1>DATASET</h1>
<p>I have used the dataset available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection">kaggle</a></p>
<p>It has 198 images as training set and 58 images as test sets.</p>
<p>The dataset folder has been divided into training and test set folders which is further divided into yes or no folders.</p>
<p>Single prediction folder contains single images of brain scans that are used to validate whether the model can predict correctly or not.</p>
<p>convolution_neural_network.py contains the main CNN code for classifying the MRI scan,this model has validation accuracy between 77%-85%</p>
